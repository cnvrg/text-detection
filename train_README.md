You can retrain the Text Detection algortihm to fine tune it for specific fonts which the default Text Detection model cannot recognize. You need to provide the training data containing images of the text of the font you want to fine on. This blueprint does training and deploys the fine tuned model which can be used for inference using API calls.

1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can now use the `Try it Live` section with any image (for example: LINK)
5. You can now integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page
6. You will now have a functioning API endpoint that returns the text in images!
