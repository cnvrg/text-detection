Use this blueprint to immediately detect and convert text in images. To use this pretrained text-detector model, create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be quickly integrated with your data and application.

This inference blueprint’s model was trained using English language data. To use custom language data according to your specific business and/or geographic region, run this counterpart’s [training blueprint](https://metacloud.cloud.cnvrg.io/marketplace/blueprints/text-detection-training), which trains the model and establishes an endpoint based on the newly trained model.

Complete the following steps to deploy a text-detector API endpoint:
1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button.
2. In the dialog, select the relevant compute to deploy the API endpoint and click the **Start** button.
3. The cnvrg software redirects to your endpoint. Complete one or both of the following options:
   - Use the Try it Live section with any text-containing image to check the model.
   - Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in the code snippet.

An API endpoint that detects English text has now been deployed. To learn how this blueprint was created, click [here](https://github.com/cnvrg/text-detection).
